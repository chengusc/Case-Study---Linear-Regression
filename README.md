# Case-Study---Linear-Regression
It is about a case study on simple linear regression. The dataset is the one on wine quality from Kaggle. 
Columns are analysed in order to choose one as exploratory variable, and 4 different models are tested. 
Data was split into training data and test data. R-squared was used to evaluate the result of the model. 
A larger value of R-squared means more variance was explained, which indicates a better model prediction.
Result shows that for single linear regression, R-squared is about 0.45, and for multiple linear regression,
R-squared can reach 0.87, indicating a high improvement in the explained variance.
